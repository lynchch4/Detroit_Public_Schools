*Values not including Pre-Kindergarten Enrollment

 

There has been a decline in enrollment across all categories, with Detroit charter schools declining 4.1% and Michigan school enrollments declining by 4.2% over the four-year period, Wayne County Schools declining by 4.6%, and Detroit Public Schools declining by 8.5%. Based on the previous four years, DPS has suffered an additional 4.4% to 3.9% decline in enrollment compared to the other sampled populations.

Southeastern(+11.4%), Central(+7.4%), Mumford(+1.4%) and Ford(+0.6%) had an increase in enrollment over this period. All other feeder patterns had a decrease in enrollment Cody(-8.3%), Osborn(-7.2%), Pershing(-7.1%), and Western(-1.8%). With EEVPA(-12.8%), Northwestern(-11.8%) and Denby(-11.1%) having a decrease in enrollment by over ten percent.

Factoring in the estimated 2.7% decline in population for the city of Detroit, assuming an even distribution across age ranges and the estimated 0.4% decline in population for the state of Michigan leaves a 2.3% difference. Using state enrollment as the baseline,  the charter schools at a +2.4% (-0.41+0.23+0.42) and the DPS schools at  -2.0% (-0.85+0.23+0.42) of the average state decline. This suggests that the charter schools are enrolling students who were previously enrolled or would have been enrolled at DPSCD. I would recommend that DPSCD focuses on charter school students and develop additional methods to entice families to enroll their students in DPSCD schools and to keep current students from switching to charter schools.

 

Next step would be looking at the enrollment by grade level, to see if any grade levels are being affected to a greater degree. A concern would be if students starting their education are enrolling in charter schools in greater numbers because that would have a cascading effect down the line with fewer students enrolled in DPS as they continue through their education. Additionally, to check if older students are being attracted to charter schools and attempt to identify potential causes.

An additional area of concern would be a possible increase in private school enrollment or homeschooling which could reduce the number students enrolled in DPS, although this would be more difficult to measure.
